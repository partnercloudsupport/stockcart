  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/image/placeholder_image.png
    - assets/image/geobrowse.png
    - assets/image/new_icon.png
    - assets/image/offer_badge.png

    - assets/image/offer_titled_image.png
    - assets/image/offerstag.png
    - assets/image/placeholder_image.png
    - assets/image/rupee_normal.png
    - assets/image/schedule_delivery_truck.png
    - assets/image/placeholder.jpg

#    - assets/image/placeholder_image.png
#    - assets/image/placeholder_image.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: JosefinSans
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/Josefin_Sans/JosefinSans-Light.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Josefin_Sans/JosefinSans-Regular.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Josefin_Sans/JosefinSans-SemiBold.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Josefin_Sans/JosefinSans-Bold.ttf
         weight: 900
   - family: OpenSans
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Light.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
         weight: 900
